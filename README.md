# Crypto Arbitrage : Analyzing Data

In this Challenge, we take on the role of an analyst at a high-tech investment firm. The vice president (VP) of the department is considering arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin trades on markets across the globe, We will try here to capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations in those markets by using the powers of Pandas.

For this assignment, we sort through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. Your task is to apply the three phases of financial analysis to determine if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin.
